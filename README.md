Codexia
===================
**codexia** is a one-stop library which contains the massive number of algorithms to implement in just few lines. 
Currently this library is in development phase, so new algorithms, and features are being added.
For now it supports algorithms for:

 - Similarity
 - String
 - Array

Similarity algorithm is used to find the percentage of similarity between documents. It uses the concept of cosine similarity. 
*In the coming updates this library will also consist of similarity between documents on the basis of semantics.*

Example:
Let's calculate the similarity between two sentences:

 1. "He is an engineer."
 2. "What type of engineer is he?"
 
Our program will give the output as: 0.6123724356957946
which is equivalent to 61.23% similar.
